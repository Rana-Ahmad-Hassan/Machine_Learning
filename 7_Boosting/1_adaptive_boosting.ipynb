    "`Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)\n",
    "`\n",
    "Adaptive Boosting, also known as AdaBoost, is a popular boosting algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It's an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`How AdaBoost Works:\n",
    "`\n",
    "1. Initial Model: A simple model is trained on the data, with equal weights assigned to each sample.\n",
    "2. Error Calculation: The errors of the initial model are calculated, and the weights of the samples are adjusted based on the errors.\n",
    "3. New Model: A new model is trained on the data, with the weights of the samples taken into account.\n",
    "4. Iteration: Steps 2-3 are repeated, with each new model attempting to improve upon the previous one.\n",
    "5. Final Model: The final model is a weighted combination of all the individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Key Features of AdaBoost:\n",
    "`\n",
    "1. Adaptive Weighting: AdaBoost adaptively adjusts the weights of the samples based on the errors.\n",
    "2. Focus on Hard Samples: AdaBoost focuses on the samples that are hardest to classify, by assigning higher weights to them.\n",
    "3. Handling Noise: AdaBoost can handle noisy data, by reducing the impact of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Advantages:\n",
    "`\n",
    "1. Improved Accuracy: AdaBoost often improves the accuracy of the base model.\n",
    "2. Handling Imbalanced Data: AdaBoost can handle imbalanced datasets, where one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the others.\n",
    "3. Robustness: AdaBoost is robust to overfitting and noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Applications:\n",
    "`\n",
    "1. Classification: AdaBoost is widely used for classification tasks, such as image classification, sentiment analysis, and medical diagnosis.\n",
    "2. Face Detection: AdaBoost is used in face detection algorithms, to detect faces in images"
